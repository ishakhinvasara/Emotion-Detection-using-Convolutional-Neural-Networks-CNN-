# Emotion-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial emotion recognition. CNNs are well-suited for image processing tasks, making them ideal for extracting features from webcam images. Trained on labeled datasets of facial expressions, CNNs analyze facial features to classify emotions accurately, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Personalized Recommendations: Based on the detected emotions, Synergy Soothe suggests personalized music and video content to the user. The

recommendations are curated to match the user's emotional state, aiming to uplift mood or provide comfort accordingly. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for Content Playback: Logistic regression and decision tree algorithms are employed to manage the playback of recommended content. Logistic regression helps in determining the probability of a user's preference for a particular song or video based on their emotional state. Decision tree algorithms aid in making playback decisions by considering various factors such as user preferences, emotional intensity, and previous interactions. Implementation: The project is implemented using Python programming language along with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras for CNN-based emotion detection and scikit-learn for logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. OpenCV is utilized for webcam image capture and processing.

Outcome: Synergy Soothe provides users with a seamless and personalized experience for managing their emotional wellbeing. By integrating emotion detection, personalized recommendations, and intelligent content playback, the project aims to soothe users' emotions and enhance their overall mood and mental health.
